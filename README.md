Just some practice creating an restfulAPI using 4 ofthe http methods(get, post, patch, delete) that will be implemented to connect to a database. 

The use of queries and a database with http methods would be also established in an real application.

please note that the js code would be replace by sql queries to achieve manipulation of a database.
